# text-adventure-guide
A how-to guide on creating a text adventure game in Java.

## Introduction
I am currently (while writing this) a student. The introductory Java course at my school requires students to create a text adventure game "Alice", based on "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carrol, which can be frustrating for new students in an introductory programming course. The scope of the project can feel overwhelming. I have helped tutor two of my fellow classmates to get started on the project and work through some of the major problem solving involved. Other classmates have asked for help as well as this can be a very intimidating project. 

It is my desire to create a text adventure guide. It is my intention to present an easy to understand object-oriented text adventure game. My code may not be the best or most optimal method. It may not follow best practices as I am still learning myself. However, I am hopefully that others may find it useful, and that it may also be a good learning experience for me to write this guide and explain my problem solving thought process. 

I do not intend to explain the absolute basics of the Java programming language and assume that the reader has a basic understanding of Java syntax, classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. It is my intention to use these concepts and help guide others to using those concepts to create a simple text-adventure project.

You are welcome to use my code as you see fit. I would appreciate it however if you would reference me, if you happen to use my code! 

Thank you!
